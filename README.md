# RSC
Relatively Simple Computer

The RSC was a semester long project I did for a computer architecture class. Itâ€™s essentially an RSC built from the ground up built using Logisim, an open-source circuitry design program. The RSC is a fully functioning computer, capable of running a custom assembly written program.
